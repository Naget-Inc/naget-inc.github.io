            <h1>Building the Future of Search and Content Discovery</h1>
            
            <section class="intro">
                <p>In today's information-rich world, traditional search engines and content platforms struggle to meet users' evolving needs for deeper, more personalized, and engaging experiences. Naget is an impact-driven company committed to revolutionizing how we generate, organize, share, and discover nuggets in a unified intuitive "everything platform".</p>

            <section class="challenge">
                <h2>The Limitations of Current Search Engines</h2>
                <p>Web search today is far from perfect. Users often find themselves overwhelmed by irrelevant results, struggling to find direct answers to complex queries. The reliance on past search patterns and click data has led to a muddle of SEO-driven results, prioritizing algorithm optimization over user satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Google's dominance in the search industry, while impressive, has become a barrier to innovation. Its vast data, speed, and infrastructure have paradoxically limited its ability to adapt to the era of Generative AI and more sophisticated user needs.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="insight">
                <h2>Google Has No Moat</h2>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, click and dwell time signals are not the unassailable moat many perceive them to be. These metrics, while profitable in the short term, can lead to a decline in result relevance and user satisfaction over time.</p>
                <p>The key to truly relevant search lies in the content itself and the authority of sources - factors that can be derived directly from the web without relying on user interaction data.</p>

                <h2>Our Vision: Instruction-Based, Personal, and Proactive Search</h2>
                <h3>Nuggets, Nuggets Everywhere</h3>
                <p>At the core of Naget's innovation are "nuggets" - useful pieces of information encountered in daily life, including websites, multimodal content, summaries, and more.</p>

                <h3>Real-Time Instruction-Based Search</h3>
                <p>Our first milestone is an end-to-end neural search engine capable of understanding complex queries and providing direct answers. This approach, while challenging, will revolutionize how users interact with information online.</p>

                <h3>Personal Library & Proactive Exploration</h3>
                <p>Naget's "nugget library" organizes personal content for easy, natural language access. Our proactive "exploration engine" goes beyond traditional search, suggesting interesting content based on user profiles.</p>

                <h3>Community-Driven Knowledge</h3>
                <p>We're fostering a collaborative environment where users co-create and promote high-quality content, aiming to surpass traditional knowledge platforms.</p>
