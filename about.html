                <h1>Building the Future of Search and Content Discovery</h1>
                
                <section>
                    <p>In today's information-rich world, traditional search engines and content platforms struggle to meet users' evolving needs for deeper, more personalized, and engaging experiences. Naget is an impact-driven company committed to revolutionizing how we generate, organize, share, and discover nuggets in a unified intuitive "everything platform".</p>

                    <h2>The Limitations of Current Search Engines</h2>
                    <p>Web search today is far from perfect. Users often find themselves overwhelmed by irrelevant results, struggling to find direct answers to complex queries. The reliance on past search patterns and click data has led to a muddle of SEO-driven results, prioritizing algorithm optimization over user satisfaction. Google's dominance in the search industry, while impressive, has become a barrier to innovation. Its vast data, speed, and infrastructure have paradoxically limited its ability to adapt to the era of Generative AI and more sophisticated user needs.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Google Has No Moat</h2>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, click and dwell time signals are not the unassailable moat many perceive them to be. These metrics, while profitable in the short term, can lead to a decline in result relevance and user satisfaction over time. The key to truly relevant search lies in the content itself and the authority of sources - factors that can be derived directly from the web without relying on user interaction data.</p>
